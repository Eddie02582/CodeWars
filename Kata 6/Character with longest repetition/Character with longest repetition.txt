For a given string s find the character c with longest consecutive repetition and return a tuple (c, l) (in Haskell Just (Char, Int), in C# Tuple<char?, int>, in Shell a String of comma-separated values c,l, in JavaScript [c,l], in Ruby [c, l]) where l is the length of the repetition. If there are two or more characters with the same l return the first.

For empty string return ('', 0) (in Haskell Nothing, in C# Tuple<char, int>(null, 0), in Shell ,0, in JavaScript ["",0], in Ruby ["", 0]).
